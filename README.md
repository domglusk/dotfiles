# dotfiles
Very messy dotfiles, but their my messy dotfiles, which I've taken inspiration from various other people

You probably shouldnt use these as your own but feel free to take snippets and add them to your own configurations. If you have any fixes or things that I've written that could be done better I'd appreciate the suggestions.

My favorite prompt is oh-my-zsh's pygmalion-virtualenv but really don't like omz so I remade it in oh-my-posh
